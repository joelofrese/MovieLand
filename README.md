# 🎬 Movie Search Web App

A React web app that searches the [OMDB database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for movies and series, and presents the results to the user.
\* Deployed to AWS Amplify [here](https://main.d3735dr4arytbp.amplifyapp.com), but OMDP API doesn't allow authentication from AWS Amplify, so it cannot fetch movie data.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
\
Enjoy your movie search! 🍿
